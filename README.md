## **Roadmap**

### **1. Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**
Focus on delivering the basic functionality:
- **Core Features**:
  - A **library view** to display games.
  - Ability to **launch games** with one click.
  - Clean, modern, and responsive UI.
- **Design Goals**:
  - Minimalist and visually polished layout.
  - Smooth animations and transitions.
- **Technical Goals**:
  - Lightweight and optimized for performance.

---

### **2. Tech Stack**
Choose a development framework and tools:
- **Options**:
  - **C++ with Qt**: For high performance and native Windows feel.
  - **Electron (JavaScript)**: Easy UI design but heavier on resources.
  - **Tauri (Rust + JS)**: Lightweight with great performance.
- Start with the tech stack that best balances performance and ease of development.

---

### **3. UI/UX Design**
Design a clean and intuitive interface:
- Use tools like **Figma** or **Adobe XD** to sketch mockups.
- Design key screens:
  - **Library View**: Display game titles, cover art, and launch buttons.
  - **Game Details** (optional for MVP): View more information about a selected game.
  - **Settings**: Basic options for themes, paths, etc.
- Incorporate dark and light mode support for aesthetic flexibility.

### **4. Core Feature Development**
#### **Game Library**:
- Store game details (title, cover art, executable path) in a lightweight database (e.g., SQLite or JSON file).
- Build a UI to display games in a grid or list format.

#### **Game Launching**:
- Implement functionality to execute game files (e.g., `ShellExecute` in C++, `child_process.spawn` in Node.js).

#### **Game Management**:
- Add manual input to add/remove game entries.
- Save game details persistently.

---

### **5. UI Polishing**
- Add smooth animations for transitions and hover effects.
- Test different color schemes, fonts, and icons to achieve the desired aesthetic.
- Optimize for responsiveness on various screen sizes and resolutions.

---

### **6. Testing and Feedback**
- Test on multiple Windows setups to ensure smooth performance.
- Gather user feedback on UI/UX to refine the launcher.

---

### **7. Post-MVP Features**
Enhance the launcher with additional capabilities:
- **Automatic Game Detection**:
  - Scan common directories (e.g., Steam, Epic Games) for installed games.

  - Synchronize settings, libraries, or saved data across devices.
- **Theme Customization**:
  - Allow users to create and apply custom themes.
- **Plugin System**:
  - Enable community-developed plugins for extra functionality.
- **Multi-OS Support**:
  - Expand support to Linux and macOS.

---

### **8. Continuous Optimization**
- Optimize resource usage to keep the launcher lightweight.
- Ensure compatibility with future OS updates.

---

### **9. Future Vision**
- Expand into a unified gaming platform with features like:
  - Social integrations (e.g., chat, friend lists).
  - News feeds for updates on installed games.
